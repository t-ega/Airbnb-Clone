# README

This is the proposed roadmap for this app. I'll add more as times goes

- Implement endpoints using graphql
- Enable CORS for production mode
- Users
  - Authentication
    - Add support for auth using JWT tokens
    - Enable email sending features using a worker e.g RabbitMQ

### TODO
- [X] Create a Rake task to automatically delete blacklisted JWT Auth tokens after they have expired.
- [] Create a Rake task to delete all tokens after they have expired
- [] Create a cron job to run the rake task
- [X] Send a confirmation token after sign up.
- [X] Send a reset token after requesting for one.
- [X] Create a confirmation endpoint to validate confirmation tokens.
- [] Use Pundit for Authorization

## User stories

This is a simplified version of Airbnb. Only worry about user stories described here.
Payments and the rest to come up later...
